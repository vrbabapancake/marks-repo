I have broad experience in technical communication, including developing detailed guides, managing knowledge bases, and creating clear, effective one-page handouts.

### Sample Job Aid:
In 2018, I created this job aid for the Toronto Transit Commission while working as a Junior Technical Writer. It provides clear, step-by-step safety guidance for operating an oxy-acetylene torch, helping ensure safe, compliant, and consistent work practices.

### Knowledge Base Article: 
From 2020 to 2024, I was responsible for managing the company knowledge base at CrowdRiff, including writing, organizing, and maintaining customer-facing support content in Zendesk. This page is one example of the practical, solution-focused articles I created to help users resolve issues and get more value from the platform.<iframe

### PDF Handout:
This one-page PDF handout was created to address a common customer friction point around account connections. Designed to be friendly, clear, and reassuring, it provides practical steps and guidance to help users feel confident and supported throughout the process.
