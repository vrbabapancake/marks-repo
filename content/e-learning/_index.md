I’ve developed e-learning courses across a wide range of subjects, including AI in incident management and drone operations.

### AI in Incident Management - PagerDuty
In 2025, I developed a comprehensive e-learning course for PagerDuty demonstrating how AI can be effectively used in Incident Management. This six-week project moved from drafting and SME interviews through to full design and implementation.

### RPA Storage - Drone Delivery Canada
In 2019, I developed a series of e-learning courses for Drone Delivery Canada focused on safely operating and maintaining remotely piloted aircraft (RPA). This module specifically covers best practices for storing the RPA to ensure compliance with operational standards.
